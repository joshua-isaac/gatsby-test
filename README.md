## Deploying Your Site

The easiest way to deploy a Gatsby website to production is to use Gatsby Cloud from the Gatsby team. Gatsby Cloud is a platform that gives your Gatsby website superpowers! With intelligent caching and incremental builds, Gatsby Cloud takes the speed and performance of your Gatsby website to another level.

## Notes

### How to Register Page Modules

1. To create a new Page Module, create a new React component within the `src/components/agility-pageModules` directory.
2. All of the Page Modules that are being used within the site need to be imported into the `index` file within the `src/components/agility-pageModules` directory and added to the `allModules` array:

```
import RichTextArea from "./RichTextArea";
import FeaturedPost from "./FeaturedPost";
import PostsListing from "./PostsListing";
import PostDetails from "./PostDetails";
import Heading from "./Heading";
import TextBlockWithImage from "./TextBlockWithImage";

const allModules = [
  { name: "TextBlockWithImage", module: TextBlockWithImage },
  { name: "Heading", module: Heading },
  { name: "FeaturedPost", module: FeaturedPost },
  { name: "PostsListing", module: PostsListing },
  { name: "PostDetails", module: PostDetails },
  { name: "RichTextArea", module: RichTextArea },
];
```

### How to Register Page Templates

1. To create a new Page Template, create a new React component within the `src/components/agility-pageTemplates` directory.
2. All of the Page Template that are being used within the site need to be imported into the `index` file within the `src/components/agility-pageTemplates` directory and added to the `allTemplates` array:

```
import MainTemplate from "./MainTemplate";

const allTemplates = [
  { name: "MainTemplate", template: MainTemplate }
];
```

### How to Properly Link to an Internal Page

To link to internal pages, use the `Link` component from gatsby.

```
import { Link } from 'gatsby';

// where post.path is the url path 
<Link to={post.path}>
  {post.title}
</Link>
```

### Resolving Linked Content

In the agilitycms-gatsby-starter, we resolve Linked Content by using [Gatsby Resolvers](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-03-04-new-schema-customization/). 

Resolvers are added to your `gatsby-node.js` in your site, and they allow you to add a new field to your content node which will handle resolving your Linked Content reference.

This means you are telling GraphQL, when you query a specific property on a node, it will actually run a function to go and get your Linked Content and return it.

An example of this can be found [here](https://github.com/agility/agilitycms-gatsby-starter/blob/main/gatsby-node.js#L155) in this starter site:

```
// gatsy-node.js

const agility = require('./src/agility/utils')

  const resolvers = {
    // on the 'agilityPost' node type
    agilityPost: {
      // get the sitemap node that represents this item ( i.e. /blog/my-blog-post )
      sitemapNode: agility.getDynamicPageItemSitemapNode(),

      // get the category
      linkedContent_agilityCategory: agility.getLinkedContentItem({
        type: "agilityCategory",
        linkedContentFieldName: "category",
      }),
    },
  }
  createResolvers(resolvers)
}

```

### Previewing Content

Previewing content prior to publishing is crucial for Editors. You can set up and configure Previews to work with Gatsby Cloud so editors can preview content as their making edits within Agility CMS.
